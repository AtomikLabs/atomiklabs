# Terraform Backend

This directory contains the Terraform backend configuration. It is deployed manually and is not part of the CI/CD pipeline. It is defined separately from the rest of the infrastructure for consistency and separation of concerns. It would also be useful in a team environment to improve collaboration and reduce the risk of conflicts.
