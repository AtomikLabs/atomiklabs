Architecture Overview
=====================

AtomikLabs leverages a serverless event-driven architecture to facilitate an automated, scalable, and cost-effective platform. By utilizing AWS services and CloudFormation templates, AtomikLabs orchestrates a series of microservices that collectively support the dissemination of AI research through podcasts and newsletters.

System Components
-----------------

The platform comprises several interconnected components, each responsible for a segment of the functionality:

ArxivDailyFetch
  The component acts as the entry point for data, invoking daily requests to the arXiv OAI service to fetch new research submissions. It deposits the fetched data into the DataBucket for further processing.

DataBucket
  Serving as the central data storage, the DataBucket holds raw research data pending parsing and summarization. It ensures data persistence and availability for downstream components.

ArxivSummaryParser
  This service processes raw data from the DataBucket, extracting and structuring relevant information into concise summaries.

ArxivSummaryPersister
  After parsing, summaries are stored in a PostgreSQL database by the ArxivSummaryPersister, which manages structured data persistence for quick retrieval and manipulation.

TtsScriptCreator
  Utilizing the structured summaries, the TtsScriptCreator generates scripts formatted for text-to-speech processing, enabling the conversion of textual data into podcast episodes.

NewsletterCreator
  Parallel to script creation, the NewsletterCreator compiles research summaries into a newsletter format, ready for distribution to subscribers.

TtsScriptProcessor
  This component processes the TtsScriptCreator's output, transforming scripts into audible speech, forming the basis of the podcast episodes.

PublishingScheduler
  It manages the timing and release of both podcasts and newsletters, ensuring content is published according to the predefined schedule.

Data Flow and Processing
------------------------

Data within AtomikLabs flows sequentially from ingestion to publication. Initiated by a scheduled event, ArxivDailyFetch retrieves new submissions and stores them in the DataBucket. The ArxivSummaryParser then accesses this data, generating summaries which are subsequently stored by the ArxivSummaryPersister. In parallel, the TtsScriptCreator and NewsletterCreator prepare content for audio and textual dissemination, respectively. The TtsScriptProcessor converts scripts into podcasts, and the PublishingScheduler handles the release, orchestrating the distribution of final content.

The architecture is designed for extensibility, allowing for the future integration of additional services such as NLP and ML tooling, which will augment the platform's capabilities in analyzing and synthesizing AI research.

Environment and Versioning
--------------------------

AtomikLabs employs a multi-environment strategy, segregating development, testing, staging, and production environments to ensure stability and facilitate continuous integration and delivery. Infrastructure as Code practices, enabled by AWS CloudFormation, allow for replicable deployments and version control of the infrastructure setup.

Monitoring and Maintenance
--------------------------

Operational visibility is achieved through comprehensive monitoring and logging, with AWS CloudWatch providing real-time insights into the system's performance and health. Maintenance routines are automated to the extent possible, with alerts configured to notify the engineering team of any anomalies requiring attention.
